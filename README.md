## A sweet little app for sweet little folks!

**Play at [www.cardyland.com](http://www.cardyland.com/)**

This was created in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) by Chris Wood, Tom Chesterton-Wood and James Chesterton-Wood as a means of playing
**Candy Land** without the physical cards. The stack of cards usually ends up toppling over, getting lost...
we've all been there!

You can use this on a computer, a phone or a tablet!

Click or tap on the card to move to the next one in the deck. Once you've been through *all* the cards,
the deck will re-shuffle and the top card will be dealt automatically.

To start a new game from scratch, click the **Start Again** button.

*Candy Land is a trademark of Hasbro. This fan-created app is unofficial.*
